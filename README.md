# Kraps

**Easily process big data in ruby**

Kraps allows to process and perform calculations on very large datasets in
parallel using a map/reduce framework and runs on a background job framework
you already have. You just need some space on your filesystem, a storage layer
(usually s3) with temporary lifecycle policy enabled, the already mentioned
background job framework (like sidekiq, shoryuken, etc) and redis to keep track
of the progress. Things you most likely already have in place anyways.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add kraps

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install kraps

## Usage

The first thing you need to do, is to tell Kraps about your desired
configuration in an initializer for example:

```ruby
Kraps.configure(
  driver: Kraps::Drivers::S3Driver.new(s3_client: Aws::S3::Client.new("..."), bucket: "some-bucket", prefix: "temp/kraps/"),
  redis: Redis.new,
  namespace: "my-application", # An optional namespace to be used for redis keys, default: nil
  job_ttl: 24.hours, # Job information in redis will automatically be removed after this amount of time, default: 24 hours
  show_progress: true # Whether or not to show the progress in the terminal when executing jobs, default: true
)
```

Afterwards, create a job class, which tells Kraps what your job should do.
Therefore, you create some class with a `call` method, and optionally some
arguments. Let's create a simple job, which reads search log files to analyze
how often search queries have been searched:

```ruby
class SearchLogCounter
  def call(start_date:, end_date:)
    job = Kraps::Job.new(worker: MyKrapsWorker)
    job = job.parallelize(partitions: 128) { Date.parse(start_date)..Date.parse(end_date) }

    job = job.map do |date, _, collector|
      # fetch log file for the date from e.g. s3

      File.open(logfile).each_line do |line|
        data = JSON.parse(line)

        collector.call(data["q"], 1)
      end
    end

    job = job.reduce do |_, count1, count2|
      count1 + count2
    end

    job = job.each_partition do |partition, pairs|
      tempfile = Tempfile.new

      pairs.each do |q, count|
        tempfile.puts(JSON.generate(q: q, count: count))
      end

      # store tempfile on e.g. s3
    ensure
      tempfile.close(true)
    end

    job
  end
end
```

Please note that this represents a specification of your job. It should be as
free as possible from side effects, because your background jobs must also be
able to take this specification to be told what to do as Kraps will run the job
with maximum concurrency.

Next thing you need to do: create the background worker which runs arbitrary
Kraps job steps. Assuming you have sidekiq in place:

```ruby
class MyKrapsWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform(json)
    Kraps::Worker.new(json, memory_limit: 128.megabytes, chunk_limit: 64, concurrency: 8).call(retries: 3)
  end
end
```

The `json` argument is automatically enqueued by Kraps and contains everything
it needs to know about the job and step to execute. The `memory_limit` tells
Kraps how much memory it is allowed to allocate for temporary chunks, etc. This
value depends on the memory size of your container/server and how much worker
threads your background queue spawns. Let's say your container/server has 2
gigabytes of memory and your background framework spawns 5 threads.
Theoretically, you might be able to give 300-400 megabytes to Kraps then. The
`chunk_limit` ensures that only the specified amount of chunks are processed in
a single run. A run basically means: it takes up to `chunk_limit` chunks,
reduces them and pushes the result as a new chunk to the list of chunks to
process. Thus, if your number of file descriptors is unlimited, you want to set
it to a higher number to avoid the overhead of multiple runs. `concurrency`
tells Kraps how much threads to use to concurrently upload/download files from
the storage layer. Finally, `retries` specifies how often Kraps should retry
the job step in case of errors. Kraps will sleep for 5 seconds between those
retries. Please note that it's not yet possible to use the retry mechanism of
your background job framework with Kraps.

Now, executing your job is super easy:

```ruby
Kraps::Runner.new(SearchLogCounter).call(start_date: '2018-01-01', end_date: '2022-01-01')
```

This will execute all steps of your job, where all parts of a step are executed
in parallel. How many "parts" a step has largely boils down to the number of
partitions you specify in the job respectively steps. More concretely, As your
data consists of `(key, value)` pairs, the number of partitions specify how
your data gets split. Kraps assigns every `key` to a partition, either using a
custom `partitioner` or the default built in hash partitioner. The hash
partitioner simply calculates a hash of your key modulo the number of
partitions and the resulting partition number is the partition where the
respective key is assigned to.

A partitioner is a callable which gets the key as argument and returns a
partition number. The built in hash partitioner looks similar to this one:

```ruby
partitioner = proc { |key| Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(key.inspect)[0..4].to_i(16) % 128 } # 128 partitions
```

Please note, it's important that the partitioner and the specified number of
partitions stays in sync. When you use a custom partitioner, please make sure
that the partitioner operates on the same number of partitions you specify.

## Datatypes

Be aware that Kraps converts everything you pass to it to JSON sooner or later,
i.e. symbols will be converted to strings, etc. Therefore, it is recommended to
only use the json compatible datatypes right from the start. However, the keys
that you pass to Kraps additionally must be properly sortable, such that it is
recommended to only use strings, numbers and arrays or a combination of those
for the keys. For more information, please check out

## API

Your jobs can use the following list of methods. Please note that you don't
always need to specify all the parameters listed here. Especially `partitions`,
`partitioner` and `worker` are used from the previous step unless changed in
the next one.

* `parallelize`: Used to seed the job with initial data

```ruby
job.parallelize(partitions: 128, partitioner: partitioner, worker: MyKrapsWorker) { ["item1", "item2", "item3"] }
```

The block must return an enumerable. The items are used as keys, values are set to `nil`

* `map`: Maps the key value pairs to other key value pairs

```ruby
job.map(partitions: 128, partitioner: partitioner, worker: MyKrapsWorker) do |key, value, collector|
  collector.call("changed #{key}", "changed #{value}")
end
```

The block gets each key-value pair passed and the `collector` block can be
called as often as neccessary. This is also the reason why `map` can not simply
return the new key-value pair, but the `collector` must be used instead.

* `reduce`: Reduces the values of pairs having the same key

```ruby
job.reduce(worker: MyKrapsWorker) do |key, value1, value2|
  value1 + value2
end
```

When the same key exists multiple times in the data, kraps feeds the values
into your reduce block and expects to get one value returned. This happens
until every key exists only once.

* `repartition`: Used to change the partitioning

```ruby
job.repartition(partitions: 128, partitioner: partitioner, worker: MyKrapsWorker)
```

Repartitions all data into the specified number of partitions and using the
specified partitioner.

* `each_partition`: Passes the partition number and all data of each partition
  as a lazy enumerable

```ruby
job.each_partition do |partition, pairs|
  pairs.each do |key, value|
    # ...
  end
end
```

## More Complex Jobs

Please note that a job class can return multiple jobs and jobs can build up on
each other. Let's assume that we additionally want to calculate a total number
of searches made:

```ruby
class SearchLogCounter
  def call(start_date:, end_date:)
    count_job = Kraps::Job.new(worker: SomeBackgroundWorker)
    count_job = count_job.parallelize(partitions: 128) { Date.parse(start_date)..Date.parse(end_date) }

    count_job = count_job.map do |date, _, collector|
      # ...

      collector.call(data["q"], 1)

      # ...
    end

    count_job = count_job.reduce do |_, count1, count2|
      count1 + count2
    end

    sum_job = count_job.map do |q, count, collector|
      collector.call('sum', count)
    end

    sum_job = sum_job.reduce do |_, count1, count2|
      count1 + count2
    end

    # ...

    [count_job, sum_job]
  end
end
```

When you execute the job, Kraps will execute the jobs one after another and as
the jobs build up on each other, Kraps will execute the steps shared by both
jobs only once.

## Dependencies
